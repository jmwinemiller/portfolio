There are many techniques that can be used in *Regression Analysis* for estimating relationships between dependent and independent variables. These relationships are normally used to find underlying trends that are used in a wide range of applications; such as making predictions, forecasting, and are widely used in machine learning. In this report the main focus will be on the topics of *Splines* and *Polynomial Estimators*. After the overview, the numerical methods will be discuss to view the advantages of splines over polynomial estimators.
