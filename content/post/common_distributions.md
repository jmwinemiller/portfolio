The process of visualizing discrete and continuous probability distributions is an essential part of statistics and data analysis. In this context, R provides a versatile and powerful environment for creating visualizations that can help understand the underlying probability distributions. This abstract presents an overview of how to graph discrete and continuous probability distributions using R. The examples provided demonstrate how to create bar plots for discrete probability distributions and line plots for continuous probability distributions. Through the use of R, users can create informative and visually appealing graphs that facilitate a better understanding of the probability distributions in question.
