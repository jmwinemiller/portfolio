This project involves creating a map of New Orleans that displays crime data from March 17 to March 21, 2023. The map is intended to provide a visual representation of the locations and types of crimes that occurred during this time period. The crime data is obtained from official sources and is processed using geospatial data analysis techniques to assign geographic coordinates to each incident. The resulting map will be interactive and will allow users to explore the crime data by location and type of crime.
